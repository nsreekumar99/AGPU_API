<h1>Affordable GPU Tracker</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>RESTful API Endpoints: Developed using .NET 8 to efficiently serve GPU data.</li>
    <li>API Consumption in Web App: Integrated the API with the web application using HttpClient to retrieve and display real-time GPU information.</li>
    <li>Dynamic Content Loading: Used AJAX and partial views to update GPU data without requiring a page reload.</li>
    <li>Responsive Table Design: Created a custom-styled, responsive table with CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for enhanced usability across different devices.</li>
    <li>Unit of Work Pattern: Implemented to manage API repositories efficiently, including asynchronous support in both the repository and unit of work.</li>
    <li>AutoMapper: Utilized for efficient data handling by mapping data between models in the Web API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Responsive Design Enhancements: The index view GPU table and sliders are currently optimized for desktop or large screen displays. Future optimizations are necessary to ensure a seamless user experience on small and medium screens.</li>
    <li>Admin Panel Development: An admin panel needs to be created to facilitate management tasks. This will involve using sessions for multi-page registration forms, ensuring that user data is preserved across different steps in the registration process. Additionally, relevant admin access labels and controls will be positioned in the footer for easy access.</li>
    <li>API Security: Strengthen API security to enhance protection against unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
